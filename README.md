This is a python written program that basically uses Selenium to scrap the menu from Mdining. 
When it runs, it will first ask the user to choose a dining hall. Then it will print out everything in the menu,
breakfast to late dinner, as well as what section is the food located. Feel free to try it out and give feedback
for better development. :)
